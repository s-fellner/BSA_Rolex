This repository contains all the work done by the group Rolex for the project of Big Scale Analytics 2021.

## Project description üóÇÔ∏è

The goal of the project is to build a model for predicting the difficulty level of a french sentence. The level concerns the reading understanding of the sentence for a native english speaker. The levels are ranked from A1 which correspond to beginner, to C1 which correspond to proficiency. 

We intend to assess the problem by building a text classifier which, based on the learning sentences we built, would suggest the language level of the sentence. 

## Methodology ü§ì 

### Step 1

Do some literature reserach that could help us solve the problem : 

***Articles:***

- Flanagan, B., Hirokawa, S., Kaneko, E., & Izumi, E. (2017). Classification of Speaking Proficiency Level by Machine Learning and Feature Selection
- Preciado-Grijalva, A., & Brena, R. F. (2018). Speaker Fluency Level Classification Using Machine Learning Techniques
- Xiaoyu Bai (2018). Automatic Classification of English Learner Proficiency Using Elicited Versus Spontaneous Data

**Step 2** 

Collect the dataset : 

We collected the french sentences from websites with exercices for non-french speakers and from articles about specific topics :

To label the data with the difficulty levels, we found some criterias in the internet : 

 - https://www.worddy.co/fr/magazine/connaitre-son-niveau-de-langue-selon-cecrl
 - https://www.france-langue.fr/niveaux-de-francais/
 - http://www.provincedeliege.be/sites/default/files/media/7476/Europass_-_European_language_levels_-_Self_Assessment_Grid.pdf


The labelled data is uploaded here as CSV. 

***Sentences dataset***
 - A1 : 199 | 16%
 - A2 : 200 | 16%
 - B1 : 223 | 18%
 - B2 : 228 | 18%
 - C1 : 203 | 16%
 - C2 : 200 | 16%
 
 ***TOTAL : 1253***
 
 There are more than 1000 sentences, but for the model building, we'll keep 200 sentences per level.

**Step 3**



There could be different way to classify sentences : 
 - Based on the overall structure of the sentence (and also the time used for the verbs)
 - The overall lexical level of the sentence (proximity to english words, technical lexic, ...)
 - The use of expressions
 - The Context in which the sentence could be used (thesis, article, advertisement, meal, personnal letter, ...)

**01.03**
 - Find CECRL scale (A1, A2, ...) evaluation system to assess the problem more precisely
 - Using contacts to find texts of each level (language school, ...)
 - Problem can be assessed globaly (global structure like article ? or like personnal letter ? ...)
 - Or can be assessed precisely, sentence per sentence and then averaged

 - Building data (sentences) based on texts found on internet : approx. 850 labelised sentences

**15.03**
 - Finishing data building (about 200 sentences per level)
